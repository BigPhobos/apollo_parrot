<h1 align="center">Apollo the Parrot</h1>

This is a silly little mod that brings TikTok and YouTube star [Apollo the parrot](https://youtu.be/tonI_hzrgrA) to Minecraft. With it installed, you'll start hearing parrots banter just like Apollo does. This includes his famous "glassk", "SUCK", "it's a bowl" and many more!

This mod also adds a new African grey parrot variant that looks just like Apollo ü¶ú

## ‚ùì Questions

### How do I install it?
Download it on [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/apollo-the-parrot) (or [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/apollo-the-parrot/comments)) and put it in your mods folder. The mod needs [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api) and [ETF](https://modrinth.com/mod/entitytexturefeatures) to function. If you've never played with mods before, I recommend [Prism Launcher](https://prismlauncher.org/).

### Can I use this mod in my modpack?
Of course you can!

### Will you maintain and update this mod?
Yes. I'm actually including this question to force myself to do it. If you're reading this and the mod isn't available for the latest Minecraft version, please complain about it [on GitHub](https://github.com/morceaudebois/apollo_parrot/issues) and I will update it.

### Will you make a Forge version?
Probably not!
